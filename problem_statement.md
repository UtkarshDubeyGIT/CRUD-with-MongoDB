## **Problem Statement**

**Title:** *Simple To-Do Application using MongoDB and JavaScript*

**Objective:**
To design and implement a simple To-Do application using JavaScript and MongoDB that allows users to manage tasks efficiently and demonstrates the use of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a NoSQL database.

**Description:**
The To-Do application will allow a user to create tasks, view all tasks, update task details or completion status, and delete tasks. The task data will be stored in a MongoDB database in the form of documents within a collection. JavaScript will be used to build the application logic and connect to the MongoDB database.

Each task will contain fields such as task title, description, status (completed or pending), and creation time. The application will perform database operations such as inserting new tasks, retrieving existing tasks, modifying task information, and deleting tasks using MongoDB queries.

This project aims to provide hands-on experience with MongoDB as a NoSQL database, document-based data modeling, and backend development using JavaScript while reinforcing the concepts of CRUD operations.

**Scope of the Project:**

* Add a new task to the database.
* View all existing tasks.
* Update task details or mark tasks as completed.
* Delete tasks from the database.

**Technologies Used:**

* JavaScript (Node.js)
* MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
* MongoDB Driver / Mongoose (for database interaction)

**Expected Outcome:**
A functional To-Do application that successfully stores and manages task data in MongoDB and demonstrates all CRUD operations through JavaScript.
